# Dash-Button-Hack

  
yeah this is just vultured off of a bunch of guides online 

I don't actually know what any of this does 

scapy to grab ARP probe, requests to POST to IFTTT URL

IFTTT does the rest

I just have to get it working on the Raspberry Pi now



necessary downloads:

python3, pip3, scapy-python3

do updates first
