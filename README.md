# Dash-Button-Hack

  
yeah this is just vultured off of a bunch of guides online 

I don't actually know what any of this does 

scapy to grab ARP probe, requests to POST to IFTTT URL

IFTTT does the rest

I just have to get it working on the Raspberry Pi now



necessary downloads:

sudo apt-get install update
sudo apt-get install upgrade

sudo apt-get install python3 (should be installed) 
sudo apt-get install python3-pip (should be installed) 

pip3 install scapy-python3 --user 
or
sudo apt-get install python-scapy

sudo apt-get install tcpdump

apparently it only works if you do 
sudo python detect-button.py

so not python 3 I guess
